----------------------React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement> used in WorkOut Form------

The React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement> is a type provided by React to represent a form submission event. It is a generic type that takes a type parameter representing the target element of the event. In this case, the target element is a form element, hence the HTMLFormElement type.
By using this type in the handleSubmit function's parameter, we are defining that the handleSubmit function is an event handler function that will be triggered when a form submission event occurs. The function will receive the form submission event as a parameter, and we can access the data submitted through the form using this event.
